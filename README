pytween
=======

module for parameter tweening in pyprocessing (http://code.google.com/p/pyprocessing/) scripts

Tweening module based on Michael Aufreiter's (https://github.com/michael) Tween.lib (https://github.com/michael/tween) library for motion tweening for processing.js (https://github.com/processing-js)

The tween.py module is basically a direct port of Tween.lib, however, it is generic enough that it could be used outside of pyprocessing, and only requires the `time` and `math` Python modules.
